## Overview

The idea behind Listing Copilot as a product is to help users quickly generate structured marketplace listings (title, bullet points, description) using AI, with authenticated access and an editable preview before publishing.

The project covers a complete product cycle:
idea validation → product requirements document → architecture → backlog → implementation → MVP deployment.

## AI-Assisted Development Workflow

This project was intentionally built using an AI-paired engineering approach, with **OpenAI Codex** integrated directly into the development workflow.

Development followed structured project documentation defined in advance (PRD, architecture, backlog). Codex was used to accelerate implementation while I maintained architectural direction and code review oversight.

The goal was to:

- Structure work into epics and backlog tasks
- Define architecture before implementation
- Use AI as a developer and execution accelerator
- Review and refine AI output across multiple development phases
